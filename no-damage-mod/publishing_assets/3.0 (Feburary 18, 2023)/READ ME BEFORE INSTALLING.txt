Abyssal's One-Hit Knock Out
Version 3.0 "The Return of the Jedi" - Feburary 18th, 2023

==

REQUIRES SCRIPT HOOK V AND SCRIPTHOOKVDOTNET.
TESTED AGAINST PATCH 1.66 FOR EPIC GAMES LAUNCHER - SHOULD WORK ON EVERYTHING ELSE.

1) Copy "ohko_config.ini" to your Documents folder and open it.
2) Adjust the keybinds as you see fit. To disable the built-in death counter, set ShowDefaultDeathCounter to False.
3) Copy "NoDamageMod.Packed.dll" to the "scripts" folder of your GTA directory.
4) Open the game, and voila! Toggle the mod using the ToggleMod keybind.

Copying the configuration is no longer necessary, and the game will load these defaults:

Increase death counter: PageUp
Decrease death counter: PageDown
Toggle the on-screen death counter: F7
Toggle the no-damage system: F8
